# Demo of how to push a dataset of 10Print images to the Hugging Face hub

This repo demos how how to create a dataset of labeled 10Print images and push them to the Hugging Face hub. You can find the dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kfahn/10Print).

The 10Print algorithm is an easy way to make random-looking mazes. For each square in a grid, either an upward or downward slash is drawn based on some random probability. If you would like to learn more about the 10Print algorithm, I recommend that you watch Daniel Shiffman's [10Print Coding Challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/76-10Print).
